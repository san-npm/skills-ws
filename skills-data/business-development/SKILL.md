## Workflow

### 1. Partner Identification

**Scoring matrix — rate each potential partner 1-5:**

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Audience overlap | 25% | Does their audience need your product? |
| Technical fit | 20% | Can you integrate/co-build? |
| Brand alignment | 15% | Compatible positioning and values? |
| Reach | 15% | Audience size and engagement |
| Strategic value | 15% | Opens new market/segment? |
| Effort to close | 10% | Decision-maker accessibility |

**Weighted score > 3.5 = pursue. 2.5-3.5 = nurture. < 2.5 = skip.**

### 2. Outreach Sequences

**Cold partner outreach (5-touch, 14 days):**

```
Touch 1 (Day 0) — Value-first intro
Subject: [Their product] + [Your product] = [specific outcome]

Hi [Name],

[One sentence showing you understand their business].
I think there's a natural fit between [their product] and [yours]
— specifically, [concrete integration/co-marketing idea].

[One sentence on what's in it for them — traffic, revenue, feature gap filled].

Worth a 15-min call to explore?

[Your name]
```

```
Touch 2 (Day 3) — Case study/proof
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Quick follow-up — [similar partnership] drove [specific result]
for [company]. Thought the model could work for us too.

Happy to share the details.
```

```
Touch 3 (Day 7) — LinkedIn engagement
Connect + comment on their recent post with genuine insight.
Then DM: "Sent you an email about [topic] — would love your take."
```

```
Touch 4 (Day 10) — New angle
Subject: Different thought on [their challenge]

Noticed [specific observation about their product/content].
We solved that for [X customers] with [approach].
Could be a co-marketing story worth telling.
```

```
Touch 5 (Day 14) — Breakup
Subject: Closing the loop

Totally understand if timing isn't right.
I'll keep an eye on [their product] — if you ever want
to explore [partnership type], I'm here.
```

### 3. Deal Pipeline

| Stage | Definition | Exit criteria | Typical duration |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Identified | Matches partner scoring criteria | Research complete, contact found | 1-2 days |
| Outreach | First touch sent | Reply received (positive or neutral) | 1-2 weeks |
| Discovery | Initial call scheduled/completed | Mutual interest confirmed, use case defined | 1-2 weeks |
| Proposal | Partnership terms drafted | Both sides reviewed, legal involved | 2-4 weeks |
| Negotiation | Terms being finalized | Agreement on commercial terms | 1-3 weeks |
| Signed | Contract executed | Integration/campaign kickoff scheduled | 1 week |
| Live | Partnership active | Revenue/metrics being tracked | Ongoing |

### 4. Partnership Models

| Model | Structure | Best for | Revenue split |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Referral | Send leads, earn commission | Low-touch, high volume | 10-20% of first year ACV |
| Reseller | They sell your product | Market expansion | 20-40% margin to partner |
| Integration | Technical product integration | Sticky, long-term | Rev share on joint customers |
| Co-marketing | Joint content/events | Brand awareness | Cost share, lead share |
| White label | They rebrand your product | Enterprise, agencies | 40-60% margin to you |

### 5. Partnership Agreement Essentials

**Non-negotiables in every agreement:**
- Revenue share % and payment terms (net 30/60)
- Exclusivity scope (or explicit non-exclusivity)
- Data sharing and privacy terms (GDPR)
- Term length and renewal conditions
- Termination clause (30-60 day notice)
- IP ownership of co-created assets
- Performance minimums (if applicable)

### 6. Co-Marketing Playbook

**Joint activities by effort level:**

| Effort | Activity | Expected reach |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Low | Guest blog post swap | 2-5k views each |
| Low | Social media cross-promotion | 1-3k impressions |
| Medium | Joint webinar | 200-500 registrants |
| Medium | Co-branded ebook/report | 500-2k downloads |
| High | Integration launch campaign | 5-20k impressions |
