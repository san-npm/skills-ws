# Community Building

## Platform Comparison

| Platform | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| Discord | Dev/gaming/crypto communities | Rich features, free, real-time | Noisy, hard to search, onboarding friction |
| Slack | B2B, professional communities | Familiar, threaded, integrations | Expensive at scale, message limits (free) |
| Circle | Course/membership communities | Clean UX, spaces, events built-in | Paid, less real-time |
| GitHub Discussions | OSS projects | Near the code, async-friendly | Limited to dev audience |
| Reddit (subreddit) | Public discovery | SEO, massive reach | Less control, trolls |

## Discord/Slack Channel Structure

```
📢 announcements        (read-only, major updates)
👋 introductions         (new members post here first)
💬 general               (main discussion)
❓ help / support        (Q&A, encourage helping each other)
💡 ideas / feedback      (product input, feature requests)
🎯 show-and-tell         (members share what they built)
🔧 off-topic             (human connection, non-work chat)
── Staff/Mod channels (private) ──
🛡️ mod-log               (actions taken)
📊 team-internal          (strategy, planning)
```

Start with fewer channels. Add only when conversation naturally splits.

## Onboarding Flow

1. **Welcome DM** (bot): "Hey! Here's how to get started" → link to intro channel + 1 quick action
2. **Intro prompt**: Template in #introductions — "Name, what you're working on, one thing you hope to get from this community"
3. **Role assignment**: React-roles or onboarding bot to self-select interests
4. **First value moment**: Within 24 hours — answer their question, feature their intro, invite to upcoming event
5. **Day 3 check-in**: DM or tag — "How's it going? Found what you need?"

**Goal**: New member → first meaningful interaction in <24 hours.

## Community Health Metrics

| Metric | How to Measure | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| DAU/MAU ratio | Active users daily vs monthly | >20% for engaged community |
| Messages per active user | Total messages / active users | 3-10/week |
| Response time | Time to first reply on questions | <4 hours |
| Retention (30-day) | Members active after 30 days | >40% |
| New member activation | % of joiners who post within 7 days | >30% |
| Lurker ratio | Read-only members / total | <80% (some lurking is fine) |

Track weekly. Use Discord analytics, Orbit, Common Room, or manual sampling.

## Engagement Tactics

### Events
- **Weekly office hours / AMA**: Founder or expert answers questions live
- **Monthly showcase**: Members demo projects (builds connection + UGC)
- **Challenges**: 7-day or 30-day challenges with public accountability

### Async Engagement
- **Question of the week**: Pinned prompt to spark discussion
- **Wins thread**: Weekly "share your win" — normalizes participation
- **Polls**: Quick opinion polls on relevant topics (low-effort engagement)

### Recognition
- Shout out helpful members in announcements
- Leaderboard or point system (careful — can feel gamified/hollow)
- Exclusive roles for active contributors

## Ambassador / Champion Program

```
Criteria to join:
- Active for 60+ days
- Consistently helpful (answers questions, welcomes newbies)
- Aligned with community values

Benefits:
- Private channel with team access
- Early access to features/roadmap
- Swag, event invites, reference/resume credit
- Direct influence on product direction

Responsibilities:
- Welcome 3+ new members/week
- Answer questions in support channels
- Flag issues/toxicity to mod team
- Attend monthly ambassador sync
```

Start with 3-5 champions. Scale to ~1 per 200 members.

## Moderation Framework

**Rules** (post in #rules, keep short):
1. Be respectful — no harassment, hate speech, personal attacks
2. Stay on topic — use appropriate channels
3. No spam or self-promotion without permission
4. Search before asking — respect everyone's time

**Escalation**: Warning → 24h mute → 7-day ban → permanent ban. Document everything in mod-log.

**Tooling**: Discord AutoMod for keyword filtering. Assign mod role to trusted members.

## Scaling Stages

| Stage | Focus | Key Actions |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0→100 | Seed & personal touch | Invite individually, be in every conversation, DM everyone |
| 100→1K | Habits & rituals | Weekly events, onboarding flow, first champions |
| 1K→5K | Systems & delegation | Mod team, ambassador program, documented processes |
| 5K→10K+ | Culture & self-sustaining | Members help members, UGC engine, sub-communities |

**Critical insight**: 0→100 is founder-led. You personally invite, personally welcome, personally engage. There's no shortcut.

## Community-Led Growth

- **Invite program**: Members invite others → recognition or perks (not monetary — attracts wrong people)
- **UGC pipeline**: Member content → amplified on company social/blog (with credit)
- **Feedback loop**: Community ideas → product roadmap → ship → announce back to community
- **Social proof**: "Join 5,000 builders" — community size as marketing asset
- **Integration with product**: Community link in app, "Ask the community" in help docs

## Feedback Loops to Product

1. Designate #ideas channel with structured template: "Problem / Proposed Solution / Who it helps"
2. Product team reviews weekly, reacts with 👀 (seen) → 🗓️ (planned) → ✅ (shipped)
3. Monthly "roadmap update" in community — what shipped from community suggestions
4. Close the loop publicly: "X suggested this, we built it" → reinforces participation

## Content from Community (UGC)

- Showcase threads → repurpose as case studies or blog posts
- Member tutorials → feature on official docs/blog with attribution
- Community quotes → use in marketing (with permission)
- Event recordings → YouTube/podcast content
