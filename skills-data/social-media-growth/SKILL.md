# Social Media Growth

## Platform Algorithms

### LinkedIn

**What the algorithm rewards:**
- Dwell time (people stop scrolling to read)
- Comments (especially long, thoughtful ones)
- Shares to DMs (private distribution)
- Early engagement (first 60 minutes critical)

**Content format performance:**

| Format | Avg. reach | Best for |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Text-only (story) | High | Personal stories, lessons |
| Carousel (PDF) | Very high | Frameworks, how-tos |
| Poll | High | Engagement, market research |
| Video (native) | Medium | Thought leadership |
| Article | Low | SEO, evergreen content |
| Image + text | Medium | Quick insights |

**Posting rules:**
- 3-5 posts per week (more = diminishing returns)
- Best times: Tue-Thu 8-10am target timezone
- Hook in first 2 lines (before "see more" fold)
- End with a question (drives comments)
- No external links in post body (kills reach) — put links in first comment
- Engage with 10-15 posts before and after publishing yours

### Twitter/X

**What the algorithm rewards:**
- Replies and quote tweets (conversation)
- Bookmark rate (save for later = high quality signal)
- Time spent on tweet (long-form, threads)
- Profile clicks from tweet

| Format | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| Thread (5-12 tweets) | Deep dives, storytelling |
| Single tweet + image | Quick insights, hot takes |
| Quote tweet with take | Building on others' ideas |
| Poll | Engagement, opinions |

**Growth tactics:**
- Reply to large accounts in your niche (first 30 min of their post)
- Build a "reply network" — 20-30 accounts you consistently engage with
- Post threads at 8am or 12pm target timezone
- Pin your best-performing thread
- Use 1-2 hashtags max (more looks spammy)

### Instagram

**Algorithm priority (2025):**
- Reels > Carousels > Static images > Stories for reach
- Saves and shares weighted higher than likes
- Watch time on Reels (completion rate)

| Content type | Cadence | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Reels | 3-5/week | Reach and discovery |
| Carousels | 2-3/week | Education, saves |
| Stories | Daily | Engagement, polls |
| Static | 1-2/week | Brand aesthetic |

**Reel optimization:**
- Hook in first 1.5 seconds
- 15-30 seconds optimal length
- Add text overlays (many watch muted)
- Use trending audio (check Reels tab)
- End with a loop (seamless replay = more watch time)

### TikTok

**Algorithm is pure content quality — followers barely matter for reach.**

- First 500 views = test group. Performance there determines viral push.
- Watch time is king (especially rewatch rate)
- Comment velocity in first hour
- Share rate to external (DMs, other platforms)

**Format rules:**
- 15-45 seconds for max completion rate
- Hook in first 1 second (pattern interrupt)
- Native look (not polished ads) outperforms production quality
- Reply to comments with video (TikTok boosts these)
- Post 1-3 times daily for growth phase

## Viral Content Mechanics

**Hook types that stop the scroll:**

| Hook type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Contrarian | "Stop posting on LinkedIn at 8am" |
| Curiosity gap | "This one change doubled our signups" |
| List/number | "5 tools I use daily that nobody talks about" |
| Story | "I got fired. Best thing that happened." |
| Challenge | "Most founders can't answer this question" |

**Viral loop anatomy:**
1. **Hook** — stop the scroll (1-2 seconds)
2. **Setup** — create anticipation (why should I care?)
3. **Payload** — deliver the value (insight, story, framework)
4. **CTA** — drive action (follow, save, share, comment)

## Content Calendar

**Weekly template (B2B SaaS):**

| Day | LinkedIn | Twitter/X | Instagram |
|-----|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Mon | Industry insight | Thread | Reel |
| Tue | Personal story | Hot take + image | Carousel |
| Wed | How-to carousel | Engage (no post) | Stories only |
| Thu | Poll or question | Thread | Reel |
| Fri | Behind-the-scenes | Casual/funny tweet | Static + story |

## Community Building

**Engagement-first strategy (first 90 days):**
1. Identify 50 accounts in your niche (mix of sizes)
2. Engage genuinely on their content daily (comment, not just like)
3. DM 5 new people weekly with specific value (not pitch)
4. Create content that references/amplifies community members
5. Host a weekly space/live/room on one topic

**Community flywheel:** Engage others → They engage you → Algorithm sees engagement → More reach → More community members → Repeat

## Growth Metrics

| Metric | Track | Benchmark |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Follower growth rate | Weekly | 2-5% week-over-week in growth phase |
| Engagement rate | Per post | LinkedIn: 3-5%, Twitter: 1-3%, Instagram: 3-6% |
| Impressions | Weekly | 10x follower count = good |
| Profile visits | Weekly | 5-10% of impressions |
| Link clicks | Per post | 1-3% of impressions |
| Saves/bookmarks | Per post | 2-5% of engagement = high-quality content |
