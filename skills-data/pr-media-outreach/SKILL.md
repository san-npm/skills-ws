# PR & Media Outreach

## Press Release Structure

```
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (or EMBARGOED UNTIL [date])

[Headline — Active Voice, <10 Words]
[Subhead — Expand with Key Detail]

[City, State] — [Date] — [Opening paragraph: Who, What, When, Where, Why]

[Body ¶1: Supporting details, data points, market context]

[Body ¶2: Quote from executive — make it sound human, not corporate]

[Body ¶3: Product/feature specifics, availability, pricing]

[Boilerplate: Company description, 2-3 sentences]

Media Contact:
[Name] | [Email] | [Phone]
###
```

**Rules**: Lead with news, not company. Include one hard data point. Keep under 500 words. Link to press kit.

## Journalist Pitch Template

```
Subject: [Specific hook] — [why their audience cares]

Hi [First Name],

[1 sentence: Reference their recent article/beat to show you read their work.]

[2-3 sentences: The news — what's happening, why it matters NOW, one proof point.]

[1 sentence: The ask — exclusive, interview, demo, or just sharing for consideration.]

Happy to send more details or jump on a quick call.

[Your name]
```

**Pitch rules**: Under 150 words. No attachments on first email. Personalize or don't send. Follow up once at +3 days, once at +7, then stop.

## Media List Building

| Source | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Muck Rack | Find journalists by beat, view recent articles |
| Twitter/X Lists | Track reporters covering your space |
| Similar stories | Who covered competitors? Pitch them. |
| Podcast directories | Filter by category, check guest history |
| HARO / Qwoted / Help a B2B Writer | Inbound journalist requests |

Build a spreadsheet: Name, Outlet, Beat, Email, Twitter, Last Pitched, Notes. Keep under 50 targets per campaign — quality over quantity.

## HARO Strategy

1. Sign up at helpareporter.com (free tier works)
2. Filter to your categories — respond within 2 hours (speed wins)
3. Format: **[Subject line matching query]** → 2-3 paragraph expert response with credentials
4. Include headshot + bio link. Don't hard-sell.
5. Track responses → ~5-10% conversion to placement is good

## Press Kit Essentials

- [ ] Company one-pager (mission, stats, founding story)
- [ ] Founder/exec bios + high-res headshots
- [ ] Product screenshots and logos (SVG + PNG, light/dark)
- [ ] Recent press coverage links
- [ ] Fact sheet (users, revenue if public, milestones)
- [ ] Brand guidelines (colors, logo usage)
- Host at `/press` or Notion page. Keep updated quarterly.

## Embargo Management

- **Set clear terms in writing**: "Embargoed until [date/time/timezone]. By replying, you agree."
- Only embargo genuinely significant news
- Give 3-7 days lead time for complex stories
- Send lift confirmation morning-of
- If broken: document, flag to journalist, adjust future access

## Product Launch PR Timeline

| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| T-6 weeks | Draft messaging, identify top 20 targets |
| T-4 weeks | Press release draft, press kit updated |
| T-2 weeks | Embargoed pitches to tier-1 journalists |
| T-1 week | Follow up, schedule interviews, prep spokespeople |
| T-3 days | Broader pitch to tier-2 and bloggers |
| Launch day | Press release wire, social push, monitor coverage |
| T+1 week | Thank reporters, share coverage internally, pitch stragglers |
| T+2 weeks | Measure results, update media list, retrospective |

## Crisis Communications Playbook

1. **Detect** — Set Google Alerts, social monitoring for brand + keywords
2. **Assess** — Severity (low/med/high), audience affected, legal implications
3. **Align** — Single spokesperson, approved holding statement within 1 hour
4. **Respond** — Acknowledge, take responsibility if appropriate, state next steps
5. **Update** — Regular cadence until resolved (every 2-4 hours for high severity)
6. **Review** — Post-mortem within 1 week, update playbook

**Golden rules**: Never say "no comment." Don't speculate. Show empathy. Be faster than the news cycle.

## Thought Leadership Placement

- Target byline-accepting outlets: TechCrunch guest posts, Forbes Councils, industry blogs
- Write about trends, not your product. Establish expertise first.
- Pitch editors with a 2-sentence abstract + outline, not a finished piece
- Repurpose across LinkedIn, company blog, newsletter

## Podcast Guesting

- Use Listennotes.com or Podchaser to find shows by topic
- Pitch: "Here's a story I can tell your audience" (not "let me promote my thing")
- Prepare 3 talking points + 1 memorable anecdote
- Send host a follow-up thank you + share episode with your audience

## PR Measurement

| Metric | Tool | Target |
|--------|------|--------|
| Media mentions | Google Alerts, Mention.com | Track volume over time |
| Share of voice | Meltwater, Brandwatch | % vs competitors |
| Domain authority from backlinks | Ahrefs, Moz | DA lift from press links |
| Referral traffic | Google Analytics (utm_source=pr) | Clicks from coverage |
| Message pull-through | Manual review | Key messages appearing in coverage |
