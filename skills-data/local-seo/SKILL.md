# Local SEO

## Google Business Profile (GBP)

### Setup Checklist
- [ ] Claim and verify listing
- [ ] Correct business name (no keyword stuffing)
- [ ] Primary + secondary categories (most specific first)
- [ ] Complete address (or service area for mobile businesses)
- [ ] Phone number (local, not toll-free)
- [ ] Website URL (to location-specific page if multi-location)
- [ ] Business hours (keep updated, mark holidays)
- [ ] Business description (750 chars, natural keywords)
- [ ] 10+ high-quality photos (exterior, interior, team, products)

### Ongoing Optimization
- Post weekly (offers, events, updates, products)
- Respond to ALL reviews within 24 hours
- Add new photos monthly
- Update seasonal hours
- Use Google Posts for promotions
- Answer Q&A section proactively

## NAP Consistency

NAP = Name, Address, Phone. Must be IDENTICAL everywhere:
- Google Business Profile
- Website footer and contact page
- All directory listings
- Social media profiles
- Schema markup

Even small variations hurt ("St." vs "Street", "Suite" vs "Ste.").

## Local Citations

Submit to top directories: [references/citation-sources.md](references/citation-sources.md)

## Local Schema

Add LocalBusiness schema to every location page: [references/local-schema.md](references/local-schema.md)

## Review Management

- Ask happy customers for reviews (email 1 week after purchase/service)
- Respond to negative reviews: acknowledge, apologize, offer resolution offline
- Never buy fake reviews (Google penalizes heavily)
- Display reviews on your website (with Review schema)
- Target: 4.0+ average, 50+ reviews for competitive niches

## Geo-Targeted Content

For each location:
- Unique location page (not boilerplate with city swapped)
- Local landmarks, events, community references
- Local testimonials from that area
- Embedded Google Map
- Location-specific schema markup
