# Blog Engine

End-to-end blog post pipeline from topic to publish-ready content.

## Pipeline

### 1. Research

Before writing, gather:
- Target keyword + 3-5 secondary keywords
- Top 5 SERP results for the keyword — analyze their structure, word count, headings
- Questions people ask (People Also Ask, forums, Reddit)
- Statistics and data points to cite
- Expert quotes to reference

### 2. Outline

Structure every post with:

```
# {Headline with primary keyword}

## Introduction (100-150 words)
- Hook: stat, question, bold claim, or story
- Problem/context
- Promise: what the reader will learn
- Optional: table of contents for 2000+ word posts

## {H2: Main Section 1}
### {H3: Subsection if needed}

## {H2: Main Section 2}

## {H2: Main Section 3}

## FAQ (3-5 questions with FAQPage schema)

## Conclusion
- Summary of key points
- CTA (download, subscribe, try, contact)
```

### 3. Draft

Writing rules:
- First sentence answers the search query (featured snippet optimization)
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Use transition words between sections
- Include a relevant image/diagram every 300-400 words
- Bucket brigades to maintain engagement ("Here's the thing:", "But wait:", "It gets better:")
- Write at 8th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid 60-70)

### 4. SEO Optimize

Checklist:
- [ ] Primary keyword in: title, H1, first 100 words, URL slug, meta description
- [ ] Secondary keywords in H2s and body naturally
- [ ] Meta description: 150-160 chars, includes keyword, has CTA
- [ ] Alt text on all images (descriptive, keyword where natural)
- [ ] Internal links: 3-5 to related posts/pages
- [ ] External links: 2-3 to authoritative sources
- [ ] URL slug: short, hyphenated, includes keyword
- [ ] FAQPage schema markup for FAQ section

### 5. Featured Snippet Optimization

Target snippet formats:
- **Paragraph snippet**: Answer the question in 40-60 words directly after the H2
- **List snippet**: Use ordered/unordered lists with 5-8 items
- **Table snippet**: Use HTML tables for comparison data
- **Definition snippet**: "X is..." format immediately after "What is X?" heading

### 6. Publish Checklist

- [ ] Proofread for grammar and spelling
- [ ] All links working
- [ ] Images compressed and have alt text
- [ ] Schema markup added (Article + FAQPage)
- [ ] Open Graph tags set
- [ ] Internal links added from existing content TO this new post
- [ ] Scheduled social media promotion
