Technical SEO Audit\n\nRun the free audit script:\n```bash\npython3 scripts/seo_audit.py \"https://example.com\"\n```\n\nManual quick checks:\n```bash\ncurl -sL \"URL\" | grep -E \"<title>|<meta name=\\\"description\\\"|application/ld\\+json\" | head -20\ncurl -s \"URL/robots.txt\"\ncurl -s \"URL/sitemap.xml\" | head -50\n```\n\nEnsure AI bots allowed in robots.txt: `Googlebot`, `Bingbot`, `PerplexityBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `ClaudeBot`, `GPTBot`, `anthropic-ai`.\n\nFull technical checklist (Core Web Vitals, crawl budget, mobile-first): references/technical-seo.md\n\n### 2. Keyword Research\n\nWith DataForSEO API (`DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` + `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` env vars):\n```bash\npython3 scripts/keyword_research.py \"keyword\" --location 2840 --language en\npython3 scripts/competitor_gap.py \"yourdomain.com\" \"competitor.com\"\npython3 scripts/serp_analysis.py \"target keyword\"\n```\n\nWithout API \u2014 use web search for volume/difficulty estimates.\n\nCluster by intent: informational \u2192 blog, transactional \u2192 landing pages, navigational \u2192 product pages. Full methodology: references/keyword-research.md\n\n### 3. GEO Optimization\n\nApply **Princeton 9 GEO Methods** \u2014 best combo: **Fluency + Statistics**:\n\n| Method | Boost | Action |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| Cite Sources | +40% | Authoritative references with links |\n| Statistics | +37% | Specific numbers and data points |\n| Quotations | +30% | Expert quotes with attribution |\n| Authoritative Tone | +25% | Confident expert language |\n| Simplify | +20% | Plain language for complex topics |\n| Technical Terms | +18% | Domain-specific vocabulary |\n| Fluency | +15-30% | Readability and flow |\n| ~~Keyword Stuffing~~ | **-10%** | **NEVER** |\n\nStructure content for AI citation: answer-first format, clear H1>H2>H3, bullet/numbered lists, tables, short paragraphs (2-3 sentences), FAQ sections with schema.\n\nPlatform-specific strategies: references/geo-optimization.md\n\n### 4. E-E-A-T Signals\n\n- Author bios with credentials on every article\n- Link to primary sources and studies\n- Display trust signals (certifications, awards, reviews)\n- Include first-hand experience and original data\n- Visible last-updated timestamps\n- Build topical authority through content clusters\n\nFull guide: references/eeat-guide.md\n\n### 5. Schema Markup (JSON-LD)\n\nGenerate structured data for every page type:\n- `WebPage`/`Article` \u2014 content pages\n- `FAQPage` \u2014 FAQ sections (+40% AI visibility)\n- `HowTo` \u2014 tutorials and guides\n- `Product` + `AggregateRating` \u2014 product pages\n- `Organization`/`LocalBusiness` \u2014 about/contact pages\n- `SoftwareApplication` \u2014 tools and apps\n- `BreadcrumbList` \u2014 navigation\n- `VideoObject` \u2014 video content\n- `Review`/`AggregateRating` \u2014 review pages\n\nTemplates: references/schema-templates.md\n\nValidate at: `https://search.google.com/test/rich-results?url={url}`\n\n### 6. On-Page SEO\n\n```html\n<title>{Primary Keyword} \u2014 {Brand} | {Secondary}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{150-160 chars with keyword}\">\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"{Title}\">\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"{Description}\">\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"{1200x630 image URL}\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\">\n```\n\nChecklist:\n- H1 contains primary keyword (one H1 per page)\n- Images have descriptive alt text with keywords\n- Internal links to related content (3-5 per page)\n- External links use `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"`\n- URL is short, descriptive, hyphenated\n- Page loads under 3 seconds\n- Mobile-friendly responsive design\n\n### 7. International SEO\n\nFor multilingual sites, implement hreflang:\n```html\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"en\" href=\"https://example.com/en/\" />\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"fr\" href=\"https://example.com/fr/\" />\n<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x-default\" href=\"https://example.com/\" />\n```\n\nFull guide: references/international-seo.md\n\n### 8. Security Audit\n\nScan competitor and referenced URLs with VirusTotal:\n```bash\nvt scan url \"https://competitor.com\"\nvt url \"https://competitor.com\" --include=last_analysis_stats\n```\n\nFlag any URLs with detections > 0 in recommendations.\n\n## References\n\n- references/technical-seo.md \u2014 Core Web Vitals, crawlability, indexing\n- references/geo-optimization.md \u2014 AI search strategies per platform\n- references/schema-templates.md \u2014 JSON-LD for 10+ page types\n- references/keyword-research.md \u2014 Clustering, intent mapping, gap analysis\n- references/eeat-guide.md \u2014 E-E-A-T signals and implementation\n- references/international-seo.md \u2014 hreflang, geo-targeting, multilingual",

Content Audit\n\nInventory existing content:\n- URL, title, word count, publish date, last updated\n- Organic traffic (from GA4/Search Console)\n- Target keyword and current ranking\n- Content type (blog, guide, landing page, case study)\n- Quality score (1-5): accuracy, depth, freshness\n\nFlag: thin content (<500 words), outdated (>12 months), cannibalized (multiple pages targeting same keyword).\n\n### 2. Competitor Content Analysis\n\nFor each competitor:\n1. Run `site:competitor.com` to estimate indexed page count\n2. Identify their top-performing content (Ahrefs/SEMrush or manual research)\n3. Map their content clusters and topic coverage\n4. Find gaps: topics they cover that you don't\n5. Find opportunities: topics neither of you covers well\n\n### 3. Topic Scoring Matrix\n\nScore each topic idea (1-5 on each, total out of 25):\n\n| Factor | Weight | Description |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Search Volume | 5 | Monthly search demand |\n| Business Relevance | 5 | How close to your product/sale |\n| Competition | 5 | Inverse of keyword difficulty |\n| Expertise Match | 5 | Your team's ability to write authoritatively |\n| Content Gap | 5 | Lack of good existing content online |\n\nPrioritize topics scoring 18+ first.\n\n### 4. Topic Cluster Design\n\nBuild pillar-cluster model:\n\n```\nPillar Page: \"Complete Guide to {Topic}\" (3000+ words)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cluster: \"How to {subtopic 1}\" (1500+ words)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cluster: \"{Topic} vs {Alternative}\" (1500+ words)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cluster: \"Best {Topic} tools\" (2000+ words)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cluster: \"{Topic} for {audience}\" (1500+ words)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Cluster: \"{Topic} examples\" (1500+ words)\n```\n\nRules:\n- Every cluster page links to its pillar page\n- Pillar page links to all cluster pages\n- Cluster pages interlink where relevant\n- One pillar per major topic area\n\n### 5. Content Calendar\n\nBuild a 90-day calendar:\n- Week 1-4: Foundation content (pillar pages, core landing pages)\n- Week 5-8: Cluster content (supporting blog posts)\n- Week 9-12: Amplification content (case studies, comparisons, guest posts)\n\nCadence: 2-4 pieces/week for growing sites, 1-2/week for maintenance.\n\nTemplate in references/content-frameworks.md.\n\n### 6. Content ROI Tracking\n\nTrack per piece:\n- Production cost (time + money)\n- Organic traffic after 90 days\n- Leads/conversions attributed\n- Revenue attributed (if measurable)\n- Cost per lead from content\n\n## References\n\n- references/content-frameworks.md \u2014 Pillar/cluster model, scoring matrix, calendar templates, editorial workflow",

Page Structure\nOptimal section order for landing pages:\n1. Hero (value prop + CTA)\n2. Social proof bar (logos or metrics)\n3. Problem statement (pain they feel)\n4. Solution (how you solve it)\n5. Features/benefits (3-4 max, benefit-first)\n6. Social proof (testimonials, case studies)\n7. How it works (3 steps)\n8. Pricing or offer\n9. FAQ (address objections)\n10. Final CTA (restate value prop)\n\n### 3. Trust Signals\n- Customer logos (known brands first)\n- Metrics: \"Used by X+ companies\" / \"Y% improvement\"\n- Testimonials with photo, name, title, company\n- Review scores (G2, Trustpilot, etc.)\n- Security badges (SOC2, GDPR, SSL)\n- Money-back guarantee badge near CTA\n\n### 4.

Template Design\n\nEach template needs:\n- **Unique intro** (not just \"{city} + {service}\" boilerplate)\n- **Data-driven content** (real statistics, comparisons, facts per entity)\n- **User value** (answers a real question, not just keyword targeting)\n- **Internal links** (to related pages within the programmatic set)\n- **Schema markup** (appropriate type per page category)\n\n### 3. Quality Thresholds\n- Minimum 500 unique words per page (not counting boilerplate)\n- At least 3 data points unique to that page\n- No more than 40% shared content across pages\n- Every page must answer at least one question a real user would have\n\n### 4.

Contact Properties\n\nEssential fields:\n- Name, email, phone, company, job title\n- Lead source (utm_source or manual)\n- Lead score (see lead-scoring skill)\n- Lifecycle stage (subscriber \u2192 lead \u2192 MQL \u2192 SQL \u2192 customer)\n- Owner (assigned sales rep)\n- Last activity date\n- Industry, company size (for segmentation)\n\nCustom fields based on your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile).\n\n### 3. Automation Rules\n\nHigh-impact automations:\n- **Lead assignment**: Route leads by territory, company size, or round-robin\n- **Follow-up reminders**: Alert if no activity for X days\n- **Stage progression**: Auto-move when criteria met (e.g., demo scheduled \u2192 Demo stage)\n- **Win/loss notifications**: Slack/email alert on deal close\n- **Lifecycle updates**: Auto-update contact lifecycle when deal moves\n- **Re-engagement**: Trigger email if deal stalls for X days\n\n### 4. Email Integration\n\n- Sync sent/received emails to contact timeline\n- Log meeting notes and call recordings\n- Track email opens and link clicks\n- Template library for common emails (intro, follow-up, proposal)\n\n### 5. Reporting Dashboard\n\nEssential reports:\n- Pipeline value by stage\n- Win rate by source/owner/month\n- Average deal cycle time\n- Activity metrics (calls, emails, meetings per rep)\n- Revenue forecast (weighted pipeline)\n- Lost deal reasons analysis\n\n### 6.

Access Control\n- [ ] `onlyOwner` / role-based access on sensitive functions\n- [ ] No unprotected `selfdestruct`\n- [ ] No unprotected proxy upgrade functions\n- [ ] Ownership transfer is two-step (propose + accept)\n- [ ] No default public visibility on state variables\n\n### 2. Reentrancy\n- [ ] External calls are last (checks-effects-interactions pattern)\n- [ ] ReentrancyGuard on functions with external calls + state changes\n- [ ] No cross-function reentrancy via shared state\n\n### 3. Integer Safety\n- [ ] Solidity 0.8+ (built-in overflow protection) or SafeMath\n- [ ] Checked division (no divide by zero)\n- [ ] Casting between types checked for truncation\n\n### 4. Input Validation\n- [ ] All user inputs validated (address != 0, amount > 0)\n- [ ] Array bounds checked\n- [ ] Ether values validated\n\n### 5. Token Handling\n- [ ] SafeERC20 for all token transfers (handles non-standard returns)\n- [ ] Check return values of `transfer` / `transferFrom`\n- [ ] Handle fee-on-transfer tokens if applicable\n- [ ] Handle rebasing tokens if applicable\n\n### 6. Flash Loan Protection\n- [ ] Price oracles use TWAP (not spot price)\n- [ ] Critical functions have minimum time delays\n- [ ] Governance votes have sufficient voting periods\n\n### 7. Front-Running Protection\n- [ ] Commit-reveal for sensitive operations\n- [ ] Maximum slippage parameters on swaps\n- [ ] Deadline parameters on transactions\n\n### 8. Gas Optimization\n- Use `uint256` instead of smaller types (EVM operates on 256-bit)\n- Pack storage variables (multiple small vars in one slot)\n- Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only function params\n- Cache storage reads in local variables\n- Use `++i` instead of `i++`\n- Use custom errors instead of require strings\n\nFull vulnerability catalog: references/vulnerability-catalog.md\nGas optimization guide: references/gas-optimization.md\nComplete audit process: references/audit-checklist.md\n\n## References\n\n- references/vulnerability-catalog.md \u2014 Top 20 vulnerabilities with examples\n- references/gas-optimization.md \u2014 Gas saving patterns\n- references/audit-checklist.md \u2014 Step-by-step audit process",
