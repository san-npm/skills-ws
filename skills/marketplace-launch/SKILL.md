# Marketplace Launch

Launch products across marketplaces and directories for maximum visibility, backlinks, and customer acquisition.

## 1. Product Hunt Launch Playbook

### Pre-Launch (2-4 Weeks Before)

**Hunter selection:**
- Top hunters get more visibility but are flooded with requests
- Self-hunting is fine now — PH algorithm no longer heavily favors known hunters
- If using a hunter: reach out 3-4 weeks early with a personal pitch, not a template
- Provide them: one-liner, tagline, description, media assets, your availability on launch day

**Asset preparation checklist:**
- [ ] Tagline: under 60 characters, benefit-focused (not feature-focused)
- [ ] Description: 260 chars max for the short description — lead with outcome
- [ ] Gallery: 5-8 images/GIFs showing the product in action (1270×760px)
- [ ] Video: 1-2 min demo (optional but boosts engagement 30%+)
- [ ] Maker comment: draft your first comment (see launch day section)
- [ ] Logo: 240×240px, clear on white background
- [ ] Thumbnail GIF: animated, eye-catching, shows core value in 3 seconds

**Community warm-up:**
- Build a launch list: email subscribers, Twitter followers, community members
- Aim for 200+ people who'll show up on launch day
- Notify them 1 week before: "We're launching on PH next [day]. Here's what we built and why."
- Reminder the night before: "We go live at 12:01 AM PT. Here's the link."
- Do NOT ask for upvotes — ask them to "check it out and share feedback"
- Engage on PH discussions 2-3 weeks before (build profile karma)

**Teaser campaign (optional but effective):**
- PH "Upcoming" page: list your product, collect followers
- Twitter/LinkedIn teaser posts: "Building something new. Launching on PH [date]."
- Behind-the-scenes content: share the build process, challenges, decisions

### Launch Day

**Timing:**
- Products go live at 12:01 AM Pacific Time
- Schedule your post to go live right at 12:01 AM PT
- Be awake and active from 12:01 AM to at least 2:00 PM PT
- The 24-hour window resets daily at midnight PT

**First maker comment (post immediately after launch):**
```
Hey PH! 👋

I'm [Name], [role] at [Product]. Here's the backstory:

[2-3 sentences: what problem you noticed, why existing solutions fail]

So we built [Product] — [one sentence value prop].

Here's what makes it different:
• [Differentiator 1]
• [Differentiator 2]
• [Differentiator 3]

[Special offer for PH community — discount, extended trial, etc.]

Would love your feedback. I'm here all day answering questions! 🙏
```

**Engagement strategy:**
- Reply to EVERY comment within 15 minutes
- Be genuine, helpful, and transparent (PH community values authenticity)
- Share additional context, roadmap items, and honest limitations
- Post 2-3 additional maker comments throughout the day with updates
- Thank supporters publicly

**Upvote ethics:**
- NEVER buy upvotes or use upvote services (PH detects and penalizes)
- NEVER directly ask for upvotes — ask people to "check it out"
- Don't send direct links to the upvote button
- Don't use VPNs or fake accounts
- PH penalizes products that get suspicious vote patterns
- Organic engagement (comments, reviews) matters more than raw upvotes

**Social amplification on launch day:**
- Tweet at launch with the PH link
- LinkedIn post: personal story angle, not just "we launched"
- Email your launch list with the link
- Post in relevant Slack/Discord communities (where allowed)
- Ask team members to share from personal accounts (not just company)

### Post-Launch

**Follow-up (days 1-7):**
- Thank everyone who commented and supported (DMs and public)
- Publish a launch retrospective blog post with real numbers
- Share results on social: "We hit #X on Product Hunt. Here's what we learned."
- Respond to all PH reviews within 48 hours
- Add PH badge to your website (social proof)

**Content repurposing:**
- Blog post: "How we launched on Product Hunt and got X upvotes"
- Twitter thread: launch lessons and tactics
- LinkedIn post: the founder story angle
- Newsletter: share with your subscriber base
- Case study: if results are strong, use for sales

**Golden Kitty Awards:**
- Nominations open annually (usually December)
- Categories: AI, Developer Tools, Design Tools, Productivity, etc.
- Being Product of the Day/Week/Month helps visibility for nominations
- Campaign for votes when nominations open
- Add "Golden Kitty Nominee" badge if nominated

## 2. AppSumo Launch

### Deal Structure

**Lifetime deal (LTD) tiers — standard model:**

| Tier | Price | What's included | Code stacking |
|------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | $49 | Single user, core features | 1 code |
| Tier 2 | $99 | 3 users, advanced features | 2 codes |
| Tier 3 | $149 | 10 users, all features | 3 codes |

**Pricing strategy:**
- Tier 1 should be roughly 1-2x your monthly price (perceived 10-20x value)
- Include features from your mid/pro plan (not just basic)
- Cap heavy usage features (API calls, storage, team seats) to manage costs
- Set a clear "LTD includes" scope to avoid future feature expectation creep

**Revenue split:**
- AppSumo typically takes 70% for the first promotion, 60% for returning partners
- You keep 30-40% of revenue
- Volume makes up for the margin: top deals do $100K-$500K+ in revenue
- Calculate: if 2000 codes sell at $49 average → ~$98K gross, ~$29K-$39K to you

### Listing Optimization

- **Title**: Clear benefit, not just product name
- **Hero image**: Show the product in action (not abstract graphics)
- **Video**: 2-3 min demo covering top 3 use cases
- **Description**: Problem → solution → proof → deal details → FAQ
- **Bullet points**: 5-7 key features with benefit-oriented language
- **Comparison**: Before/after or vs. alternatives table

### Review Management & Taco Rewards

- AppSumo uses "Taco" ratings (1-5 tacos)
- Reviews heavily influence future buyers — aim for 4.5+ average
- Respond to every review, especially negative ones, within 24 hours
- For negative reviews: apologize, offer direct support, update when resolved
- Happy customers: ask them to leave a review in your follow-up email
- Taco average affects your placement on AppSumo's featured page

### Post-Deal Customer Retention

- LTD customers are high-churn risk (bought on deal, not on value)
- Onboard them aggressively: welcome email sequence, setup wizard
- Set expectations early: what's included in LTD vs. what's future paid
- Build a community (Facebook group or Discord) for LTD users
- Convert LTD users to paid: offer annual upgrade with additional features
- Track LTD customer NPS separately from regular customers

## 3. G2 / Capterra / TrustRadius

### Profile Optimization

**G2:**
- Complete every profile section (description, media, integrations, pricing)
- Add 10+ screenshots and 1-2 videos
- List all relevant categories (primary + secondary)
- Add comparison alternatives (helps you show up in vs. pages)
- Update quarterly with new features and screenshots

**Capterra:**
- Detailed product description with keyword optimization
- Feature list matching Capterra's taxonomy
- Accurate pricing (buyers filter by price)
- High-res screenshots of key workflows

**TrustRadius:**
- Vendor profile with complete product information
- TrustMap positioning (based on reviews)
- Buyer intent data (TrustRadius shares this with vendors)

### Review Generation Campaigns (Ethical)

**Email campaign template (send to happy customers):**
```
Subject: Quick favor — 2 min review on G2?

Hi [Name],

You mentioned [specific positive result] with [Product].
Would you mind sharing that experience on G2?

It takes ~2 minutes: [direct review link]

Honest feedback only — we value authentic reviews.

As a thank you, [small incentive: gift card, swag, donation to charity].

[Signature]
```

**Rules:**
- Only ask customers who've expressed satisfaction (NPS 8+, support CSAT 4+)
- Never incentivize for positive reviews — incentivize for honest reviews
- G2 allows gift cards up to $25 for review incentives
- Space requests: don't ask 50 people the same week (looks artificial)
- Target: 10 reviews/month until you hit 50+, then 5/month maintenance

**Review generation funnel:**
1. Identify happy customers (NPS 8+, CSAT 4+, active users)
2. Personal email from their account manager (not marketing blast)
3. Follow up once after 5 days if no review
4. Thank them personally when review appears
5. Track who's reviewed where to avoid duplicate asks

### Category Selection Strategy

- **Primary category**: Where your closest competitors are (even if it's competitive)
- **Secondary categories**: Adjacent categories with less competition
- Check each category: how many competitors, review volume, leader quadrant positions
- Smaller categories = easier to become a "Leader" badge holder
- Leader/High Performer badges are powerful sales tools (add to website, email signatures, sales decks)

### Comparison Page Optimization

- G2 auto-generates comparison pages ("Product A vs Product B")
- You can influence these with: more reviews, complete profile, feature checklist accuracy
- Create your own comparison pages on your website targeting "[Competitor] vs [You]" keywords
- Link to your G2 profile from comparison pages for authority

### SEO Benefits of Directory Backlinks

- Most directories provide DoFollow backlinks (direct SEO value)
- Builds domain authority early (critical for new sites)
- Branded anchor text distribution looks natural to Google
- Category pages drive referral traffic for relevant searches
- Being listed as an "alternative to [competitor]" captures competitor search traffic
- Track backlink acquisition: aim for 20-30 directory backlinks in first month

## 5. Launch Timing & Sequencing

### Recommended Sequence

| Week | Platform | Why this order |
|------|----------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Indie directories (20-30 submissions) | Build backlinks, initial visibility |
| 3 | BetaList | Early adopter audience, momentum |
| 4 | Product Hunt | Peak visibility, biggest audience |
| 5 | Hacker News (Show HN) | Technical audience, if relevant |
| 6-7 | G2/Capterra/TrustRadius profiles | Start review collection |
| 8-10 | AppSumo (if applicable) | Revenue spike, user acquisition |
| 11-12 | Review campaigns | Build social proof on G2/Capterra |

### Seasonal Considerations

- **Best months for PH**: January-March (new year energy, high engagement), September-October (post-summer)
- **Avoid**: Late December (low traffic), major holidays, big Apple/Google events
- **Best day for PH**: Tuesday-Thursday (highest engagement). Avoid Friday-Sunday.
- **AppSumo**: Best in Q1 and Q4 (deal-buying season)
- **G2 reviews**: Best to collect in Q1/Q3 (before G2's quarterly report cycles)

### Avoiding Launch Fatigue

- Don't launch everywhere in the same week — spread over 8-12 weeks
- Each launch should have a slightly different angle or message
- Rotate your launch list: don't email the same supporters for every platform
- Save your biggest push for Product Hunt (most competitive, most reward)
- Track engagement per channel — if a community stops responding, take a break

## 6. Metrics & Tracking

### What to Track Per Platform

| Platform | Key Metrics |
|----------|-------------|
| Product Hunt | Upvotes, comments, rank (#X of day), website traffic spike, signups from PH, referral traffic (30 days) |
| AppSumo | Codes sold, revenue, refund rate, taco rating, review count, LTD-to-paid conversion |
| G2 | Review count, average rating, category rank, comparison page views, buyer intent leads |
| Capterra | Review count, rating, clicks to website, lead form submissions |
| Directories | Referral traffic per directory, backlink status (indexed?), signup attribution |

### Attribution Setup

**UTM convention for marketplace launches:**
```
https://yourproduct.com/?utm_source=producthunt&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=launch-2026-q1
https://yourproduct.com/?utm_source=appsumo&utm_medium=marketplace&utm_campaign=ltd-feb-2026
https://yourproduct.com/?utm_source=g2&utm_medium=review-site&utm_campaign=profile
https://yourproduct.com/?utm_source=betalist&utm_medium=directory&utm_campaign=launch-2026
https://yourproduct.com/?utm_source=saashub&utm_medium=directory&utm_campaign=listing
```

- Use unique UTMs for every directory and marketplace
- Track in GA4: create a "Marketplace" channel group
- Set up conversion events: signup, trial start, purchase
- Monitor 30-day post-launch cohort (marketplace users vs. organic)

### ROI Calculation Per Channel

```
Channel ROI = (Revenue from channel - Cost of channel) / Cost of channel × 100

Cost includes:
- Listing fees (if any)
- Time spent preparing and managing (value your hours)
- Special discounts or deals offered
- Creative/asset production costs

Revenue includes:
- Direct signups attributed to channel (UTM)
- LTV of acquired customers (not just first purchase)
- SEO value of backlinks (estimate: $50-200 per quality dofollow link)
- Brand awareness (harder to quantify — use branded search volume as proxy)
```

**Tracking dashboard (update monthly):**

| Channel | Cost | Users Acquired | Paying Customers | Revenue | Backlinks | ROI |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------------|---------|-----------|-----|
| Product Hunt | $0 + 40h | — | — | — | 1 (DR91) | — |
| AppSumo | 60% rev share | — | — | — | 1 (DR80) | — |
| G2 | $0 + 10h | — | — | — | 1 (DR92) | — |
| Directories (30) | $200 + 15h | — | — | — | 25-30 | — |
| BetaList | $129 + 5h | — | — | — | 1 (DR64) | — |
| Total | — | — | — | — | — | — |
