The OSS simplifies VAT compliance for **cross-border B2C sales** within the EU:

- **Who**: Any business selling goods/digital services to consumers in other EU countries
- **Threshold**: €10,000 combined cross-border B2C sales to all EU countries. Below this, charge your home country VAT rate. Above, charge destination country rate.
- **How**: Register for OSS in ONE EU country (your establishment). File a single quarterly return covering all EU B2C sales. Pay all VAT through one portal.
- **Union OSS**: For EU-established businesses selling B2C goods/services cross-border
- **Non-Union OSS**: For non-EU businesses supplying digital services to EU consumers
- **Filing**: Quarterly — by end of month following quarter (e.g., Q1 due April 30)

### IOSS — Import One-Stop Shop

For goods imported into the EU with value ≤ €150 sold B2C:
- Collect VAT at point of sale (destination country rate)
- Report via single monthly IOSS return
- Goods clear customs VAT-free (expedited)
- Non-EU sellers must appoint an EU intermediary

### Reverse Charge Mechanism (B2B)

Cross-border B2B services within the EU:
- Supplier issues invoice **without VAT** (0%)
- Invoice must state: "Reverse charge — Art. 196 Council Directive 2006/112/EC"
- Buyer self-assesses VAT on purchase (input and output = net zero if fully deductible)
- Both parties must have valid EU VAT numbers — verify via VIES (https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/)

### Digital Services VAT (since July 2021)

All B2C digital services (SaaS, streaming, e-books, online courses, cloud services) are taxed at the **customer's country** rate:
- Determine customer location via 2 non-contradictory pieces of evidence: IP address, billing address, bank country, SIM card country
- Use OSS to report and pay
- No de minimis for digital services supplied by non-EU businesses

## 9. Accounting Standards

### IFRS vs Local GAAP

| Country | Listed Companies | Unlisted/SMEs | Local GAAP Name |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Austria | IFRS mandatory | Austrian GAAP (UGB) or IFRS | UGB (Unternehmensgesetzbuch) |
| Belgium | IFRS mandatory | Belgian GAAP or IFRS | Belgian Accounting Standards (CBN/CNC) |
| Bulgaria | IFRS mandatory | National Accounting Standards or IFRS | NAS |
| France | IFRS mandatory | French GAAP (PCG) required; IFRS not permitted for statutory accounts | PCG (Plan Comptable Général) |
| Germany | IFRS mandatory | German GAAP (HGB) required; IFRS only for consolidated (optional) | HGB (Handelsgesetzbuch) |
| Ireland | IFRS mandatory | FRS 102 / FRS 105 (Irish/UK GAAP) or IFRS | FRS 102 (The Financial Reporting Standard) |
| Italy | IFRS mandatory | Italian GAAP (OIC) or IFRS | OIC (Organismo Italiano di Contabilità) |
| Luxembourg | IFRS mandatory | Lux GAAP or IFRS | Lux GAAP (based on EU Directives, adapted locally) |
| Netherlands | IFRS mandatory | Dutch GAAP (RJ) or IFRS | RJ (Raad voor de Jaarverslaggeving) |
| Poland | IFRS mandatory | Polish Accounting Act or IFRS | Ustawa o Rachunkowości |

**Key rule**: IFRS is mandatory for consolidated accounts of EU-listed companies (EU Regulation 1606/2002). For statutory (individual entity) accounts, most countries require or prefer local GAAP.

### Country-Specific Charts of Accounts

| Country | Chart of Accounts | Structure |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| France | PCG (Plan Comptable Général) | Mandatory standardized chart. Class 1-5: Balance sheet. Class 6-7: P&L. 7-digit account codes. |
| Germany | SKR03 or SKR04 | Industry standard (not legally mandatory). SKR03: process-oriented. SKR04: function-oriented. 4-digit accounts. |
| Belgium | MAR (Minimum Algemeen Rekeningenstelsel) | Mandatory minimum chart. Similar structure to French PCG. |
| Spain | PGC (Plan General de Contabilidad) | Mandatory. 9 groups. Similar to French system. |
| Netherlands | No mandatory chart | Companies use own structure. RGS (Referentie Grootboekschema) available as optional standard. |
| Italy | No mandatory chart | OIC provides recommended structure. Most follow convention based on Civil Code Art. 2424-2425. |
| Luxembourg | No mandatory chart (adapting) | Typically follows a structure similar to Belgian/French charts. eCDF (electronic filing) requires standard mapping. |

### Audit Requirements (Simplified)

Most EU countries require statutory audit when a company exceeds 2 of 3 thresholds:
- EU Directive thresholds (transposed nationally with variations):
  - **Balance sheet total**: ~€6M (varies: €4.4-6M by country)
  - **Net turnover**: ~€12M (varies: €8.8-12M by country)
  - **Average employees**: 50

Small companies below all thresholds are generally exempt from audit (some countries: exempt from filing detailed accounts too).
