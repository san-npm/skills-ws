# Influencer Marketing

## Influencer Tiers

| Tier | Followers | Engagement Rate | Cost Range | Best For |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Nano | 1K-10K | 4-8% | $50-500/post | Niche communities, authenticity |
| Micro | 10K-100K | 2-5% | $500-5K/post | Targeted reach, high trust |
| Mid | 100K-500K | 1.5-3% | $5K-25K/post | Scale + engagement balance |
| Macro | 500K-1M | 1-2% | $25K-75K/post | Brand awareness campaigns |
| Mega | 1M+ | 0.5-1.5% | $75K-500K+/post | Mass reach, cultural moments |

**Rule of thumb:** Micro/nano influencers deliver 60% higher engagement per dollar than macro. Start there.

## Identification & Vetting

**Discovery sources:**
- Platform native search (hashtags, explore, creator marketplaces)
- Tools: CreatorIQ, Grin, Upfluence, Modash, HypeAuditor
- Your own followers and customers (best ambassadors)
- Competitor mentions and tags

**Vetting checklist:**
- [ ] Engagement rate within tier norms (use HypeAuditor to check)
- [ ] Audience demographics match your target (location, age, gender)
- [ ] Fake follower check (<15% suspicious accounts)
- [ ] Content quality and brand alignment review (last 20 posts)
- [ ] No brand-damaging controversy (search name + "controversy"/"cancel")
- [ ] Previous sponsored content performance and disclosure compliance
- [ ] Audience overlap with your existing following (<30% ideal)

See `references/vetting-scorecard.md` for the full evaluation template.

## Outreach

**Cold DM/email template:**

```
Subject: Collab idea — [specific thing you liked about their content]

Hi [Name],

Loved your [specific post/video] about [topic] — especially [detail].

I'm [Name] from [Brand]. We [one-line what you do].

We'd love to partner on [specific idea, not vague]. Thinking:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

Compensation: [range or "happy to discuss"]. Would you be open to a quick chat?

[Name]
```

**Key principles:**
- Reference specific content (proves you actually follow them)
- Lead with the creative idea, not your brand deck
- Be upfront about compensation — don't waste anyone's time
- Follow up once after 5-7 days, then move on

## Contract Essentials

Every influencer agreement must cover:

| Clause | What to Specify |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Deliverables | Exact formats, quantities, platforms |
| Timeline | Draft due, revision window, publish dates |
| Usage rights | Where you can repost, for how long (6-12 months typical) |
| Exclusivity | Category exclusivity period and scope |
| Payment terms | Amount, schedule (50/50 or net-30), kill fee |
| Content approval | Number of revision rounds, turnaround time |
| FTC/disclosure | Required disclosure language and placement |
| Performance bonus | Optional: bonus for exceeding KPI thresholds |
| Termination | Exit conditions for both parties |

See `references/influencer-contract-template.md` for a starter agreement.

## Content Approval Workflow

```
Brief sent → Creator drafts (5-7 days) → Brand reviews (48h) →
Revisions if needed (1-2 rounds max) → Final approval → Publish on agreed date
```

**Approval guidelines:**
- Provide clear brief upfront, not vague direction
- Max 2 revision rounds (more kills authenticity)
- Review for: disclosure compliance, factual accuracy, brand safety
- Do NOT rewrite their voice — trust the creator's style

## Influencer Brief Template

1. **Campaign overview:** Goal, key message, target audience
2. **Deliverables:** Format, platform, quantity, length
3. **Key talking points:** 3-4 max (not a script)
4. **Must-include:** Product name, CTA, discount code, link
5. **Must-avoid:** Competitor mentions, claims you can't substantiate
6. **Disclosure:** "#ad" or "#sponsored" — visible, not buried
7. **Creative references:** Examples of tone/style you like (from THEIR feed)
8. **Timeline:** Draft due, publish window, reporting period

See `references/creative-brief-template.md` for the full document.

## Compliance: FTC & EU Requirements

**FTC (US):**
- Disclosure must be clear and conspicuous — "#ad" at the START of captions
- "Thank you [Brand]" is NOT sufficient disclosure
- Video: verbal disclosure within first 30 seconds
- Stories: text overlay on EACH story frame, not just the first

**EU (GDPR + national laws):**
- Similar transparency requirements; varies by country
- Germany: strict — must label as "Werbung" (advertising)
- UK ASA: "#ad" required, must be immediately obvious

**Platform-specific:**
- Instagram/TikTok: use built-in "Paid Partnership" tag AND text disclosure
- YouTube: check "contains paid promotion" box AND verbal disclosure

## ROI Tracking Setup

**For every campaign, set up:**

```
UTM link:    ?utm_source=influencer&utm_medium=[platform]&utm_campaign=[creator-name]
Promo code:  [CREATORNAME15] — unique per influencer
Affiliate:   Platform-specific tracking link (Impact, PartnerStack, etc.)
```

**Attribution tracking:**
- Direct: UTM clicks, promo code redemptions, affiliate conversions
- Indirect: Brand search lift, social mentions, follower growth during campaign
- Assisted: Multi-touch attribution if your stack supports it

## Platform Strategies

| Platform | Content Type | Best Approach |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Instagram | Reels, Stories, carousels | Visual storytelling, lifestyle integration |
| TikTok | Short-form video | Trend-native, authentic, less polished |
| YouTube | Long-form, Shorts | Deep reviews, tutorials, integrations |
| LinkedIn | Posts, articles, video | Thought leadership, B2B credibility |

## Campaign Measurement Framework

| Metric | Awareness | Consideration | Conversion |
|---------------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Impressions/reach | ✓ | | |
| Engagement rate | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Saves/shares | | ✓ | |
| Link clicks | | ✓ | ✓ |
| Promo code uses | | | ✓ |
| Revenue attributed | | | ✓ |
| CAC vs other channels| | | ✓ |
| Brand lift (survey) | ✓ | ✓ | |

## Ambassador Programs vs One-Off Campaigns

| Factor | One-Off | Ambassador (3-12 months) |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Trust built | Low — feels like an ad | High — repeated endorsement |
| Cost efficiency | Higher per-post CPM | Lower CPM, volume discounts |
| Content quality | Variable | Improves over time |
| Best for | Product launches, testing | Brand building, sustained growth |

**Ambassador program structure:**
- 3-6 month minimum commitment
- Monthly content cadence (2-4 posts)
- Exclusive perks: early access, product input, events
- Performance reviews quarterly with option to renew
