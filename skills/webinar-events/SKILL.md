# Webinar Events

## Funnel Overview

```
Registration → Confirmation → Reminders → Live Event → Follow-up → Replay → Conversion
```

Target benchmarks: 40-50% attendance rate, 20-30% replay views, 5-15% conversion to next action.

## Platform Selection

| Platform | Best For | Max Attendees | Key Feature |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Zoom Webinar | B2B, corporate | 10,000 | Polls, Q&A, breakout rooms |
| StreamYard | Multi-stream, casual | 1,000 | Simulcast to social |
| Riverside | High-quality recording | 8 speakers | Local HD recording |
| Demio | Marketing-focused | 1,000 | Built-in CTAs, handouts |
| Webflow + OBS | Full custom | Unlimited | Total brand control |

## Registration Page Optimization

**Must-have elements:**
- Headline: Specific outcome + timeframe ("Learn X in 45 minutes")
- 3-4 bullet points of what attendees will learn
- Speaker headshot + 1-line bio
- Date/time with timezone converter
- Social proof (attendee count, company logos, testimonials)
- Single-field form (email only) or max 3 fields

**Conversion boosters:**
- Urgency: "Limited to 500 seats" (if true)
- Calendar add button on confirmation page
- SMS reminder opt-in checkbox

See `references/registration-page-template.html` for a starter layout.

## Email Sequence

| Timing | Email | Subject Line Pattern | Key Element |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Immediately | Confirmation | "You're in! [Event] details" | Calendar invite attachment |
| 7 days before | Value builder | "Why [topic] matters now" | Content teaser, speaker intro |
| 1 day before | Reminder | "Tomorrow: [Event] at [time]" | Join link, agenda preview |
| 1 hour before | Final reminder | "Starting in 60 min — join now" | Direct join link only |
| 1 hour after | Follow-up | "Recording + resources inside" | Replay link, slides, CTA |
| 3 days after | Replay nudge | "Missed this? Watch the replay" | Key moments timestamps |
| 7 days after | Conversion push | "[Specific offer] expires Friday" | Time-limited CTA |

See `references/email-sequence-templates.md` for copy templates.

## Attendance Rate Optimization

Target: 40-50% of registrants attend live.

**Pre-event tactics:**
- Send calendar invite (ICS file) in confirmation email
- SMS reminders (boosts attendance 15-20%)
- Pre-event engagement: poll or survey ("What's your biggest challenge with X?")
- Shorter lead time: promote 7-10 days out, not 30

**Day-of tactics:**
- Send 3 reminders: morning, 1 hour, 15 minutes
- "Starting in 5 min" email with direct join link
- Social media countdown posts

## Content Structure (60-min format)

```
[0-5 min]   Welcome + housekeeping (mics, Q&A, recording notice)
[5-10 min]  Hook: State the problem, share a surprising stat
[10-35 min] Education: 3 key insights with examples
[35-45 min] Demo/case study: Show the solution in action
[45-50 min] CTA: Clear next step with incentive
[50-60 min] Live Q&A
```

**Rules:**
- Never start with your company story — start with THEIR problem
- One slide per minute maximum
- Include interactive elements every 10 min (poll, chat prompt, quiz)
- Save the pitch for minute 35+ after you've delivered value

## Q&A Management

- Assign a dedicated Q&A moderator (not the presenter)
- Pre-seed 3-5 questions to avoid dead air
- Group similar questions: "Several people asked about..."
- Flag unanswered questions for follow-up email
- Use upvoting if platform supports it

## Co-Hosted Webinars

**Partner selection criteria:**
- Complementary (not competing) audience
- Similar audience size (0.5x-2x yours)
- Established email list they'll promote to

**Logistics checklist:**
- [ ] Agree on promotion split (each partner sends X emails)
- [ ] Shared registration page with both logos
- [ ] Lead sharing agreement signed before promotion
- [ ] Joint rehearsal 48 hours before
- [ ] Post-event: share attendee list per agreement

## Content Repurposing Workflow

```
Live Webinar
├── Full replay → Gated landing page
├── 3-5 short clips (60-90s) → Social media, YouTube Shorts, Reels
├── Key quotes → Social graphics (Canva templates)
├── Transcript → Blog post (edit, don't just publish raw)
├── Slides → SlideShare / PDF lead magnet
├── Q&A answers → FAQ page or knowledge base
└── Audio track → Podcast episode
```

See `references/repurposing-checklist.md` for the full workflow.

## Metrics & Reporting

| Pipeline generated | Opportunities from attendees | — | — |

## Post-Event Review

After every webinar, document:
1. What resonated most (poll results, chat spikes, Q&A themes)
2. Drop-off point (when did people leave?)
3. Technical issues encountered
4. Top 5 unanswered questions → next webinar topics
5. Pipeline and revenue attribution at 30/60/90 days

See `references/post-event-template.md` for the review framework.
