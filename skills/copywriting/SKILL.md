# Copywriting v2

Write marketing copy that converts. Every page element has a job — make sure it does it.

## Core Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)
1. **Problem**: Name the pain the reader feels
2. **Agitate**: Make the pain vivid and urgent
3. **Solve**: Present your product as the answer

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
1. **Attention**: Bold headline or surprising stat
2. **Interest**: Expand with relevant details
3. **Desire**: Show benefits and social proof
4. **Action**: Clear, specific CTA

### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)
1. **Before**: Current painful state
2. **After**: Dream outcome achieved
3. **Bridge**: Your product is how they get there

### 4Us (Useful-Urgent-Unique-Ultra-specific)
Score every headline 1-4 on each U. Aim for 12+.

## Page-by-Page Playbook

### Homepage
- Hero: One clear value proposition (what + for whom + why different)
- Subheadline: Expand on the benefit or address the "how"
- Social proof bar: logos, numbers, or testimonial
- 3 feature blocks: benefit-first headlines, not feature labels
- Final CTA section: restate the value prop with urgency

### Landing Page
- One goal per page (no navigation distractions)
- Headline matches the ad/link that brought them
- Benefits > features (what it does FOR them)
- Social proof close to CTA
- Single, repeated CTA button

### Pricing Page
- Anchor with the most expensive plan first (or highlight recommended)
- Name plans by persona ("Starter", "Growth", "Scale") not size
- Feature comparison table with checkmarks
- FAQ section addressing objections
- Money-back guarantee near CTA

### Feature Page
- Lead with the outcome, not the feature name
- Show don't tell: screenshots, demos, examples
- Compare old way vs new way
- Testimonial from someone who uses THIS feature
- CTA: try this specific feature

## CTA Optimization

Rules:
- Use first person: "Start my free trial" > "Start your free trial"
- Be specific: "Get the report" > "Submit"
- Add value: "Create my account (free)" > "Sign up"
- Reduce risk: "Try free for 14 days — no credit card"
- One primary CTA per page section

## Voice & Tone

Define for every brand:
- **Voice** (constant): Professional? Casual? Playful? Authoritative?
- **Tone** (varies by context): Landing page = confident, Error page = helpful, Email = friendly

Rules:
- Write at 6th-8th grade reading level
- Short sentences (15-20 words average)
- Active voice always
- "You" more than "we"
- Cut every word that doesn't earn its place
