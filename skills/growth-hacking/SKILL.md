# Growth Hacking

## AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics)

| Stage | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Acquisition** | New signups/visitors | Channel-dependent |
| **Activation** | % completing key action | 40-60% |
| **Retention** | Day 7/30 retention | 25%/15%+ |
| **Revenue** | Conversion to paid | 5-15% |
| **Referral** | Viral coefficient (K) | >0.5, ideally >1 |

Focus on fixing the leakiest stage first.

## Viral Loop Design

Types of viral loops:
1. **Inherent**: Product requires sharing (Slack, Zoom, Dropbox shared folders)
2. **Incentivized**: Reward for referring (Dropbox storage, Uber credits)
3. **Word-of-mouth**: Product so good people talk about it
4. **Content**: User-created content gets shared (Canva, Spotify Wrapped)

Viral coefficient K = invites × conversion rate. K>1 = exponential growth.

## Product-Led Growth (PLG)

Key principles:
- Free tier or trial with real value (not crippled)
- Self-serve onboarding (no sales call needed)
- Aha moment within first session
- Usage-based expansion (natural path to paid)
- In-product sharing and collaboration

## Experimentation

### ICE Framework
Score each experiment 1-10:
- **Impact**: How big is the potential upside?
- **Confidence**: How sure are you it'll work?
- **Ease**: How easy is it to implement?

Total = I + C + E. Run highest scores first.

### RICE Framework
- **Reach**: How many users affected per quarter?
- **Impact**: Minimal (0.25) → Massive (3)
- **Confidence**: Low (50%) → High (100%)
- **Effort**: Person-weeks to build

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

## Retention Hooks

- **Habit loop**: Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment
- **Progress mechanics**: Streaks, levels, completion percentage
- **Loss aversion**: "You'll lose your streak" / "Your data will be deleted"
- **Social proof**: "Your team is using this" / "3 colleagues joined"
- **Notification strategy**: Email, push, in-app — context-dependent timing
