# Competitor Intelligence

## Workflow

### 1. Competitor Identification

**Three tiers:**

| Tier | Definition | Track |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Direct | Same product, same market | Deep: pricing, features, messaging, every move |
| Adjacent | Different product, same buyer | Monitor: major launches, positioning changes |
| Aspirational | Where you want to be in 2-3 years | Quarterly: strategy, positioning, market moves |

**Discovery methods:**
- Search your top 5 keywords — who ranks?
- Ask churned customers who they switched to
- Check G2/Capterra/TrustRadius category pages
- Monitor "alternatives to [your product]" searches
- Track who bids on your brand keywords

### 2. Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | You | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Core feature 1 | Full | Full | Partial | None |
| Core feature 2 | Full | None | Full | Full |
| Integration X | Full | Partial | None | Full |
| API access | All plans | Enterprise only | Pro+ | None |
| SSO/SAML | Pro+ | Enterprise only | All plans | Enterprise only |
| Support SLA | 4h (Pro) | 24h | 8h | 12h |
| Pricing (entry) | $49/mo | $79/mo | $39/mo | $99/mo |
| Free tier | Yes | No | Yes (limited) | No |

**Rules:**
- Be honest. Don't mark competitors as "None" when they have partial support.
- Update quarterly minimum — features change fast.
- Note which plan includes each feature (not just "has it").
- Source every claim (link to their docs/pricing page).

### 3. Positioning Map

**2x2 matrix — choose two axes that matter to your buyers:**

Common axis pairs:
- Ease of use ↔ Feature depth
- SMB focus ↔ Enterprise focus
- Price ↔ Capability
- Self-serve ↔ High-touch
- Horizontal ↔ Vertical/specialized

**How to place competitors:**
1. Score each competitor 1-10 on both axes
2. Use customer reviews, demos, and published materials (not assumptions)
3. Identify the white space — where are there no competitors?
4. Position yourself in or near the white space (if it has demand)

### 4. Win/Loss Analysis

**Interview framework (20-min call with recent wins AND losses):**

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What triggered the search for a solution? | Understand buying trigger |
| What alternatives did you evaluate? | Competitive set |
| What were your top 3 criteria? | Decision factors |
| Why did you choose [winner] / not choose us? | Win/loss reason |
| What almost changed your mind? | Close call factors |
| How was the buying experience? | Process feedback |

**Aggregate analysis (quarterly, minimum 20 interviews):**
- Win rate by competitor: Who do we beat most? Lose to most?
- Top 3 win reasons: What keeps winning deals for us?
- Top 3 loss reasons: What keeps losing them?
- Feature gaps cited: What do prospects wish we had?
- Pricing feedback: Are we perceived as expensive, fair, cheap?

### 5. Sales Battlecards

**Template (one per competitor):**

```markdown
# Battlecard: [Competitor Name]

## Quick Facts
- Founded: [year] | HQ: [city] | Employees: ~[X] | Funding: $[X]M
- Pricing: [starting price] - [enterprise price]
- Target: [who they sell to]

## They Say (their positioning)
"[Their tagline/main claim]"

## We Say (our counter-positioning)
"[How we differentiate — one sentence]"

## When We Win
- [Scenario 1: specific situation where we're stronger]
- [Scenario 2]
- [Scenario 3]

## When We Lose
- [Scenario 1: specific situation where they're stronger]
- [Scenario 2]

## Landmines (questions to ask prospects to highlight our strengths)
- "How do they handle [area where competitor is weak]?"
- "What happens when you need [feature they lack]?"
- "Have you looked into their [known pain point — pricing, support, etc.]?"

## Objection Handling
| Their claim | Our response |
|-------------|-------------|
| "[Competitor claim 1]" | "[Factual counter with proof]" |
| "[Competitor claim 2]" | "[Factual counter with proof]" |

## Proof Points
- [Customer who switched from them to us + result]
- [Head-to-head benchmark or comparison data]
- [Review quote from G2/Capterra]
```

### 6. Monitoring

**Ongoing competitive intelligence:**

| Source | Frequency | What to track |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Their website/blog | Weekly | Messaging changes, new features, pricing |
| G2/Capterra reviews | Monthly | Sentiment trends, new complaints |
| Job postings | Monthly | Strategic direction (hiring = investing) |
| Social media | Weekly | Positioning, customer conversations |
| Press/funding | As it happens | Funding rounds, partnerships, acquisitions |
| Their product | Quarterly | Sign up for free trial, document UX |

**Competitive newsletter (internal, monthly):**
- Top 3 competitive moves this month
- Win/loss trend update
- New feature comparison updates
- Pricing or positioning changes
- Recommended battlecard updates
